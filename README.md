This is the source code for [track.bible](https://track.bible).

This is a Vue app and uses Vue CLI, so the best way to understand how it is put together is to be familiar with Vue CLI. Commands for running/building/testing can be listed via `npm run`. Some scripts used to deploy or generate assets are written in Python and a virtual env can be created using `pipenv install`.
