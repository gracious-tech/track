# APP VERSIONING

# A simple form of versioning for apps (as opposed to libraries)

# Differences:
#     1. Only major.minor.patch is used, not any extra labels
#         Major for changes to user data
#         Minor for changes to features
#         Patch for fixes
#     2. App must always be stable on production domain
#         Only ever beta on production domain when version < 1
#     3. App is assumed unstable when on testing domain
#         Once new versions pass testing on testing domain they can move to production without changes
#         So production may jump versions if problems found
